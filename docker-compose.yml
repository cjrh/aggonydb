    # By default, a Postgres database is running on the 5432 port.
    # If we want to access the database from our computer (outside the container),
    # we must share the port with our computer's port.
    # The syntax is [port we want on our machine]:[port we want to retrieve in the container]
    # Note: You are free to change your computer's port,
    # but take into consideration that it will change the way
    # you are connecting to your database.
    ports:
      - 55432:5432

    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: admin # The PostgreSQL user (useful to connect to the database)
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password # The PostgreSQL password (useful to connect to the database)
      POSTGRES_DB: default_database # The PostgreSQL default database (automatically created at first launch)

#  volumes:
#    # In this example, we share the folder `db-data` in our root repository, with the default PostgreSQL data path
#    # It means that every time the repository is modifying the data inside
#    # of `/var/lib/postgresql/data/`, automatically the change will appear in `db-data`
#    # You don't need to create the `db-data` folder. Docker Compose will do it for you
#      - ./db-data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
